#### Coursera Machine Learning Specialization

You can get this course by filling out a good financial aid form on Coursera. [link](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction?adgroupid=156621904981&adposition=&aid=true&campaignid=21092529272&creativeid=693270366211&device=c&devicemodel=&gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIkKXnzZO9hgMVd2hBAh2C_QaVEAAYASAAEgJovPD_BwE&hide_mobile_promo&keyword=coursera+machine+learning&matchtype=p&network=g&utm_campaign=b2c_emea_machine-learning-introduction_stanford_ftcof_specializations_arte_march_24_dr_geo-multi-set2_sem_rsa_gads_lg-all&utm_medium=sem&utm_source=gg).
After filling out the form, you will have to wait 16 days exactly. If you fill out the form well (do not generate content from ChatGPT), you will surely get the course for free. I suggest you apply for financial aid for every possible course on this list. To not leave you waiting 16 days to start grinding, here's a YouTube collection of the first course. You can start right away: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFX8k1kXhOw&list=PLkDaE6sCZn6E7jZ9sN_xHwSHOdjUxUW_b).
